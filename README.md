## Setup

This project uses [Pipenv](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for dependency management. 

```
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

You are now in the correct virtual environment shell. 

## Inference

As the weights are comparably small, they are included in the weights directory of this git. This git also includes an `inference_images` folder. You can places images inside the example folder, where each sample is placed in its folder.

Performing an inference on own data is then performed with the `infer.py` script:

```
python infer.py --data inference_images -s weights/shape_graph.pb -i weights/illumination_graph.pb -b weights/brdf_graph.pb -j weights/joint_graph.pb --gpu 0
```

Notice that per default, a Low Dynamic Range sRGB image is expected. If the data is available in linear color space or High Dynamic Range format, the `--linear` or `--hdr` option can be used respectively.

## Training

Performing full retraining is due to the sequential nature of the pipeline, also a sequential process. Each network first needs to be trained, then a complete inference step on the dataset needs to be executed. 

**If not already done, download the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14mou3Va65deimPYE5GtFdK8OS3I0BSzq/view?usp=sharing) first and extract it.**

```
python train_stage.py shape --data PATH_TO_DATASET/training --save TRAINDIR/brdf --gpu 0
python advance_stage.py shape --data PATH_TO_DATASET/training -w TRAINDIR/brdf/compact.pb --gpu 0

python train_stage.py illumination --data PATH_TO_DATASET/training --save TRAINDIR/illumination --gpu 0
python advance_stage.py illumination --data PATH_TO_DATASET/training -w TRAINDIR/illumination/compact.pb --gpu 0

python train_stage.py brdf --data PATH_TO_DATASET/training --save TRAINDIR/brdf --gpu 0
python advance_stage.py brdf --data PATH_TO_DATASET/training -w TRAINDIR/brdf/compact.pb --gpu 0

python train_stage.py joint --data PATH_TO_DATASET/training --save TRAINDIR/joint --gpu 0
python advance_stage.py joint --data PATH_TO_DATASET/training -w TRAINDIR/joint/compact.pb --gpu 0
```

After the training is done a `compact.pb` file exists in the specified training directory. This file can then be used for the inference.

## Configuration

Each stage of the training can be altered using command line parameters. Consult the `--help` option of the `train_stage.py` script for a detailed explanation. Additionally, the render config can be altered in the `config/render_config.json` file.
